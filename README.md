This webpage was built with Jonas Schmedtmann's latest course, "<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/?couponCode=LETSLEARNNOW"><strong>Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS</strong></a>". Reuploaded because it was uploaded originally in my Old github account which I lost access.
